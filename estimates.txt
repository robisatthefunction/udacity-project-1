There will be about 4 minutes and 10 seconds of downtime or RTO for a single AZ outage. Because there is a standby instance in another AZ in that region, it will be automatically promoted to primary instance but will take about 4min to boot up based on doing a reboot with failover myself. There is synchronous replication between multi-AZ replicas, meaning very little lag and less data loss in the case of a failover, therefore RPO will be about the same as RTO. For multi region read-replica’s, you want to be sure to monitor your primary DB for failure, and in the case of failure, you will have to manually promote your read replica in another region and direct DB traffic to the new primary instance. You will also need to create a replacement read replica with the promoted DB instance as its source. Cross region read replica promotion takes a bit longer to become available once it has been promoted with an RTO of 6min (based on my testing). Cross region read replica does asynchronous replication (data is copied to the replica after it is already written to the primary) causing the RPO to be a bit higher than the RTO if there was data that wasn’t able to be sent to the replica when the primary database went down.
