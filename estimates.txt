There will be almost zero downtime or RTO for a single AZ outage because the standby instance in another AZ in that region will be automatically promoted to primary instance if you have multi-AZ enabled. The RPO will be very low because of this as well, but you must consider any lag in replication that may occur between the two DB’s, which could cause data loss when the primary instance goes down. For multi region read-replica’s, you want to be sure to monitor your primary DB for failure, and in the case of failure, have a process triggered that promotes the read replica in the other region, direct DB traffic to the promoted instance and create a replacement read replica with the promoted DB instance as its source. Cross region read replica promotion can take a couple of minutes and is slower to promote a read replica than cross AZ, consequently giving a higher RPO.
